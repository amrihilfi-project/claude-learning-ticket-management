# Ticket Management System

## Project Overview
An AI-powered support ticket management system for handling student support emails.

## Tech Stack
- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, React Router v7 (`client/`)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Prisma (`server/`)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **AI**: Claude API (Sonnet 4.6)
- **Queue**: Redis + BullMQ
- **Auth**: Better Auth — email/password, sessions in PostgreSQL via Prisma adapter, RBAC (ADMIN / AGENT roles), sign-up disabled (users seeded by admin script)
- **Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose

## Common Commands
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `bun install` | Install all workspace dependencies |
| `bun run --filter '*' dev` | Start both client and server |
| `bun run --filter server dev` | Start server only |
| `bun run --filter client dev` | Start client only |
| `bun test:e2e` | Run Playwright E2E tests |

## Component Testing

Use **Vitest** + **React Testing Library** for component tests in the `client/` package.

### Commands
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `bun run --filter client test` | Run all component tests once |
| `bun run --filter client test:watch` | Watch mode — re-runs on file change |
| `bun run --filter client test:ui` | Browser UI — interactive dashboard for writing tests |

### Setup
- Test environment: `jsdom` (configured in `client/vite.config.ts`)
- Global matchers: `@testing-library/jest-dom` (loaded via `client/src/test/setup.ts`)
- Test files: co-located with the component, named `*.test.tsx`

### Writing tests
- Use `renderWithProviders` from `client/src/test/renderWithProviders.tsx` — it wraps the component in `QueryClientProvider` + `MemoryRouter`
- Mock `axios` with a factory so all methods are `vi.fn()`:
  ```ts
  vi.mock("axios", () => ({
    default: { get: vi.fn(), post: vi.fn(), patch: vi.fn(), delete: vi.fn() },
  }));
  const ax = vi.mocked(axios);
  ```
- Mock `authClient.useSession` from `../lib/auth-client` to control session state
- Always call `afterEach(() => vi.useRealTimers())` when any test uses `vi.useFakeTimers()` — fake timers bleed into later tests and break `@base-ui/react` portals (they use `requestAnimationFrame`)
- Use `fireEvent.click()` for buttons that open `@base-ui/react` dialogs — `userEvent.click()` hangs due to focus-trap internals
- Use `userEvent.setup({ delay: null })` for typing into inputs
- Find dialog content by heading (`findByRole("heading", { name: /.../ })`) rather than `role="dialog"` — the popup role may not be set until after animation

### After writing tests, always run them
Run `bun run --filter client test` and fix any failures before reporting the task as done.

## E2E Testing

Always use the **`playwright-e2e-writer`** agent when writing or expanding E2E tests. Invoke it whenever:
- A new feature or page has been implemented and needs test coverage
- An existing flow needs additional or updated test cases
- New test utilities, fixtures, or helpers are required

The agent owns all Playwright configuration, test setup details, and best-practice patterns for this project.

## Documentation
Always use Context7 MCP to fetch current documentation for any library or framework used in this project — including Bun, Express, React, React Router, Vite, Prisma, TailwindCSS, and the Claude API.

Steps:
1. Call `resolve-library-id` with the library name and your question
2. Call `query-docs` with the resolved library ID and your question
3. Use the fetched docs to answer accurately

Do not rely on training data alone for library-specific syntax, configuration, or APIs.

## UI Components
Use **shadcn/ui** when creating new UI components. Add components via:
```bash
bunx --bun shadcn@latest add <component-name>
```
Components are added to `client/src/components/ui/`. Already installed: button, card, input, label, alert, badge, dialog, select.

## Data Fetching
- Use **axios** for all HTTP requests in the client (`import axios from "axios"`)
- Use **TanStack Query** (`@tanstack/react-query`) for all server state:
  - `useQuery` for fetching — include relevant variables in the query key so refetches are automatic
  - `useMutation` with `onSuccess: () => qc.invalidateQueries(...)` for writes
  - `placeholderData: (prev) => prev` on paginated queries to avoid loading flashes
- `QueryClientProvider` is already set up in `client/src/main.tsx`

## Auth Patterns
- Client session: `authClient.useSession()` from `better-auth/react`
- Role check: `(session?.user as any)?.role` — role is an `additionalFields` field, not typed in the SDK
- Route protection: `<ProtectedRoute roles={["ADMIN"]}>` — non-matching roles redirect to `/`
- New users: seeded via scripts in `server/prisma/` using `hashPassword` from `better-auth/crypto` + Prisma `user` + `account` records

## Key Decisions
- API calls from client to `/api/*` are proxied to the server via Vite config
- AI responses are always agent-approved before sending (no auto-send)
- Refund Request tickets route to a dedicated queue, never auto-responded
- Ticket statuses: open → pending → resolved → closed (auto-close after 24h)
- Tickets reopen automatically if student replies to a resolved/closed ticket
